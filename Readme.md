Survivor Struggle is a Unity (C#) 2D action-platformer that showcases scalable game AI. Enemies use modular finite state machines—from charge-and-explode creepers to a multi-phase Boss that enrages based on damage thresholds—while aerial foes navigate via A* pathfinding over waypoint graphs. The player can run, jump, and switch between melee (sword) and ranged (projectiles), with precise hit masks, proximity sensing, and ledge/wall checks enabling reactive combat. The codebase emphasizes clean architecture with reusable base states, clear transitions, and tunable difficulty knobs (detection radii, speeds, damage, cooldowns), making it easy to add new enemies or extend behaviors.
